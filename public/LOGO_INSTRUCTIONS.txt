BAAREZ LOGO SETUP
==================

Please add the Glimmora logo to this directory as "logo.png"

The logo will be used in:
1. Navigation bar (top left)
2. Footer
3. Branding throughout the site

Recommended specifications:
- File name: logo.png
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Dimensions: At least 200px wide for quality
- The logo will be automatically scaled to fit (h-12 / 48px in navbar)

Alternative:
If you have the logo in a different format (SVG, JPG, etc.),
you can rename this file to match and update the references in:
- src/components/Navbar.jsx (line 73)
- src/components/Footer.jsx (line 56)
